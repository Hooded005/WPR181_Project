        <h3>She was the one</h3>
        <p>
            You may not believe me when I say Jakkie and I first met each other in a video game store 2 years ago. 
            Funny as both of us were looking to buy the new Animal Crossing game, this was before the covid pandemic
            craze over the game. We made some small talk, exchanged gamertags and did not think much about it further.
            But as covid struck and lockdown came about, both our daily routines involved Animal Crossing and we got to know
            each other more and on a deeper level. Once lockdown got lifted a bit we arranged to go on a coffee date, and it just
            spiraled into where we are now from there.</p>

        <h3>He was the perfect man</h3>
        <p>
            For some reason, I always wondered how it would feel like to experience that "love at first sight”
            moment like in the movies and to find my happily ever after, and not just dream about it.
            The day I met Chang in a video game store we exchanged contact details and did not think it will go further than 
            gaming friends. But a global pandemic had different plans. We started playing games together and there were some things 
            about him that caught my attention; his politeness, his gentleness, and his kindness to just name a few of many.
            The way he spoke to me, the way he made me feel comfortable around him in these scary times, hr made me laugh every time I said
            something stupid. Who would thought that a silly little game about cute animals would lead up to saying “I do”?<br>
            Today I am proud to say that I have found my happily ever after.
